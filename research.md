Many online platforms rely on user-generated content and need to incentivize free effort. In this paper, I investigate if users provide more and better quality contributions when endowed with more autonomy over actions. Using a dynamic discrete choice model, I show that control rights have positive marginal value that is heterogeneous across different types of users, where types are ex-ante identifiable by the platform. I simulate counterfactuals with different delegation designs. Results show that the platform would lose an important share of production and quality of content in absence of delegation, specifically due to the responses of certain groups of users.

The transmission of information is crucial for productivity and growth, but language differences may limit its effectiveness. In this paper, I empirically investigate how much communication effort is affected by the exogenous cost of language, and investigate the trade-off faced by knowledge platforms in implementing their website in multiple languages. I exploit the introduction of websites for languages different from English on a question-and-answering platform and compare the behavior of non-English speaking users before and after the introduction. Results show that the quality of communication improves by more than 24% when writers use their first language, rather than English, and answers are 7% more likely to solve the questioner's problem, a 20% increase from baseline. In addition, the size of the effect is complementary to incentives and the questioner's effort. With the introduction of other languages, the community size increases, but the quality of the contribution of the new joiners is lower. Finally, information is more dispersed. These results show a non-trivial trade-off between one and multiple languages for knowledge platforms.

**Information Transmission and Organizational Form: Evidence from the Enron Corporation**

<p style="font-size:14px"> 
Organizational design is often meant to reduce inefficiencies in information transmissions within the organization. Building on the theoretical predictions of Cr√©mer, Garicano, and Prat (2007), I exploit data from the Enron scandal to study how employees' language and communication depend on the hierarchy structure. I match a large database of emails from employees of the Enron corporation with data recovering the position in the company, obtaining a panel of 1557 employees. I find that workers in higher positions of the hierarchy use larger vocabularies and broader languages, but more specialized messages. Results support the hypothesis that higher-ranked employees adopt, in the communication network, a role of intermediation between specialized divisions, while lower-ranked employees may be the collectors of information.

**Market power and conservative bias in professional advice** *with Astrid Hopfensitz (TSE) and Elena Panova (TSE)* 
<details>
  <summary style="font-size:13px"><b>Read abstract</b></summary>

<p style="font-size:14px"> 
A sizable literature on reputational cheap-talk suggests that professional advisors may confirm the common priors regardless of their true opinion, so as to appear "smart" and thereby increase the future demand for advice. We run an experiment to investigate whether- and to which extent confirming the common priors helps increasing demand for advice and whether- and how the answer depends on adviser market power.
