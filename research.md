The transmission of information is crucial for productivity and growth. However, language differences may limit its effectiveness. This is particularly relevant for knowledge platforms that aim to be global, given the cultural diversity of the pool of users. In this paper, I empirically investigate how the exogenous cost of language affects communication quality and the trade-offs faced by knowledge platforms in implementing their website in multiple languages. I exploit the staggered introduction of websites for languages other than English on a question-and-answer platform to demonstrate two main facts. First, non-native English speakers who contribute in English increase their answers' quality once able to use their native language, and their answers are more likely to solve the questioner's problem. The native-language answers drive the effect, which is larger when the question quality is higher and the incentives are stronger. Second, users who participate in their native language but not in English contribute lower-quality answers compared to those who contribute in English. This suggests that lower language barriers allow users with less expertise in the subject to participate. These results show that the platform should adopt multiple languages to maximise the quality of the information collected, although doing so may also result in an inflow of low-quality content from new users.

In many organisations, employees' learning and productivity rely on knowledge platforms' user-generated content, which has become a standard daily source of information for various tasks. As users contribute on a voluntary basis, platforms need to incentivise free effort. With data from Stack Exchange, I investigate whether users provide more and better quality contributions when endowed with more control over actions. Using a dynamic discrete choice model, I show that autonomy has positive marginal value that is heterogeneous across different types of users. I simulate counterfactuals with different designs. The results show that the platform would lose an important share of production and quality of content in the absence of delegation. When delegation is based on performance, the platform faces a trade-off, which depends on the composition of the community, and the tasks that the platform wants to incentivise.

**Information Transmission and Organizational Form: Evidence from the Enron Corporation** [NEW DRAFT COMING SOON]

<p style="font-size:14px"> 
Firms' production efficiency heavily depends on the quality of information flows within the firm. However, weak incentives or cognitive constraints may prevent optimal communication across employees. Several theories have studied these frictions and discussed how the design of hierarchies and the strategic allocation of decision rights can reduce them (Dessein 2002; Garicano 2000; Cr√©mer, Garicano, and Prat 2007). This paper tests theoretical predictions using email data from the Enron Corporation. I constructed a unique panel dataset for 1557 Enron employees from September 1999 to January 2002 by merging email text data with senders' roles and positions in the hierarchy extracted from email attachments. Using Large Language Models, I classify emails, identifying those that provide information, request information, or delegate tasks. In addition, I categorise them by degree of language specialisation. I find that vertical information flows are primarily due to higher-raked employees requesting information and lower-ranked employees providing it. Higher-ranked employees use less specialised languages; however, they write more specialised messages when writing to other divisions, suggesting higher language skills that allow more effective communication across divisions. Finally, I find that after the sudden resignation of CEO Jeff Skilling, higher-ranked employees reduced their requests for information from their subordinates while increasing the provision of information. This result aligns with the theory that higher-ranked employees gain a more relevant role in acquiring and providing information in moments of uncertainty and unexpected events.

**Market power and conservative bias in professional advice** *with Astrid Hopfensitz (EMLyon) and Elena Panova (TSE)*

  <summary style="font-size:14px"><b>Read abstract</b></summary>

<p style="font-size:14px"> 
A sizable literature on reputational cheap-talk suggests that professional advisors may confirm the common priors regardless of their true opinion, so as to appear "smart" and thereby increase the future demand for advice. We run an experiment to investigate whether- and to which extent confirming the common priors helps increasing demand for advice and whether- and how the answer depends on adviser market power.
