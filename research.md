**Delegation as Incentive: Evidence from an Online Community** (JMP)
Experimental evidence shows that indivuals value control and power per se, but little evidence identifies this type of non-monetary utility in real data. In this paper I show that the behavior of internet users contributing on a voluntuary basis is affected by the degree of control they have over possible actions. After developing a dynamic discrete choice model of contribution in a *question and answer* website, I estimate the marginal utility from control. I then simulate counterfactual patterns of contributions under different degrees of delegation of control, to quantify the trade offs in terms of plarform success of different incentive structures.

**Communication Costs, Incentives and Effort Decision**  
This project aims to help bridging the gap between the strategic information transmission literature and the team theoretic literature of constrained language, where incentives are perfectly aligned but the message space is bounded. Building on a simple model of pairwise communication with endogenous effort decisions, exogenous cost of language, and degree of incentive alignment, I test predictions on optimal effort and equilibrium quality of communication. I exploit a question and answering platform that introduced websites for languages different from English, and observe behavior of non-English speaking users before and after the introduction. Preliminary results show that content quality increases significantly when written in the first language of the writer.

**Information Transmission and Organizational Form: Evidence from the Enron Corporation**  
As inefficiencies in information transmissions are a main concern for organizations, organizational design is often meant to facilitate communication within the organization. In this paper I aim to test the theoretical predictions of Cr√©mer, Garicano, and Prat (2007), which address this crucial decision of firms. With this aim, I use the largest publicly available database of emails employees of the Enron corporation. After recovering the position in the company for 2800 employees, I observe variation both in the cross section and time for the communication structure of the divisions, which will allow me to see not only how different organizational distances affect communication, but as well the impact of centrality within the information network on careers probability.
