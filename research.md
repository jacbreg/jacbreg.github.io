**Authority and Delegation in Online Communities** (JMP)  
Many online platforms rely on user-generated content and need to incentivize free effort. In this paper, I investigate if users provide more and better quality contributions when endowed with more autonomy over actions. Using a dynamic discrete choice model, I show that control rights have positive marginal value that is heterogeneous across different types of users, where types are ex-ante identifiable by the platform. I simulate counterfactuals with different delegation designs. Results show that the platform would lose an important share of production and quality of content in absence of delegation, specifically due to the responses of certain groups of users.

**Communication Costs, Incentives and Effort Decision**  
This project aims to help to bridge the gap between the strategic information transmission literature and the team theoretic literature of constrained language, where incentives are perfectly aligned but the message space is bounded. Building on a simple model of pairwise communication with endogenous effort decisions, exogenous cost of language, and degree of incentive alignment, I test predictions on optimal effort and equilibrium quality of communication. I exploit a question-and-answering platform that introduced websites for languages different from English, where I observe the behavior of non-English speaking users before and after the introduction. Preliminary results show that content quality increases significantly when written in the first language of the writer.

**Information Transmission and Organizational Form: Evidence from the Enron Corporation**  
As inefficiencies in information transmissions are an important concern for organizations, organizational design is often meant to facilitate communication within the organization. In this paper, I aim to test the theoretical predictions of Cr√©mer, Garicano, and Prat (2007), which address this crucial decision of firms. With this aim, I use a large publicly available database of emails from employees of the Enron corporation. After recovering the position in the company for 2800 employees, I observe variation both in the cross-section and in time for the communication structure of the divisions. This allows me to correlate the information flows with the organizational design and the individual careers' paths.

**Market power and conservative bias in professional advice** *with Astrid Hopfensitz (TSE) and Elena Panova (TSE)*  
A sizable literature on reputational cheap-talk suggests that professional advisors may confirm the common priors regardless of their true opinion, so as to appear "smart" and thereby increase the future demand for advice. We run an experiment asking whether- and to which extend confirming the common priors helps increasing demand for advice? Whether- and how does the answer depend on adviser market power?  
*[The implementation of the experiment has been postponed due to the health crisis]*
