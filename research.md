**Delegation as Incentive: Evidence from an Online Community** (JMP)  
Experimental evidence shows that individuals value control and authority, but few works have confirmed this results out of the lab. In this paper I identify and estimate the marginal utility of control over actions within online communities, exploiting a dynamic discrete choice model. I find that users value the allocation of control, but differently across different types of participants. In addition, all users are affected in their participation, as control induces long run positive effects on participation. As users in online communities are not remunerated, the understanding of non monetary drivers of contributions allow companies to maximize the success and profitability of online platforms. With this aim in mind, I then simulate counterfactual production histories under different systems rules and incentive structures. This allows me to investigate the trade offs digital companies face when allocating control rights.

**Communication Costs, Incentives and Effort Decision**  
This project aims to help bridging the gap between the strategic information transmission literature and the team theoretic literature of constrained language, where incentives are perfectly aligned but the message space is bounded. Building on a simple model of pairwise communication with endogenous effort decisions, exogenous cost of language, and degree of incentive alignment, I test predictions on optimal effort and equilibrium quality of communication. I exploit a question and answering platform that introduced websites for languages different from English, and observe behavior of non-English speaking users before and after the introduction. Preliminary results show that content quality increases significantly when written in the first language of the writer.

**Information Transmission and Organizational Form: Evidence from the Enron Corporation**  
As inefficiencies in information transmissions are a main concern for organizations, organizational design is often meant to facilitate communication within the organization. In this paper I aim to test the theoretical predictions of Cr√©mer, Garicano, and Prat (2007), which address this crucial decision of firms. With this aim, I use the largest publicly available database of emails employees of the Enron corporation. After recovering the position in the company for 2800 employees, I observe variation both in the cross section and time for the communication structure of the divisions, which will allow me to see not only how different organizational distances affect communication, but as well the impact of centrality within the information network on careers probability.
