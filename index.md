Welcome to my website!

I am an Assistant Professor (Lecturer) at the [University of Liverpool, Management School, Department of Economics](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/economics/).
  
I received my PhD from the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/).

My field of research is Organizational Economics.  
I work at the intersection of personnel economics, the economics of digitization, and behavioral economics.

I study empirically incentive structures and information transmission both online and offline.
