Welcome to my website!

I am a PhD candidate at the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/). In September 2021 I will join the Economics group at the [University of Liverpool, Management School](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/management/).

My field of research is Organizational Economics.  
I work at the intersection of personnel economics, the economics of digitization, and behavioral economics.

I study empirically incentive structures and information transmission both online and offline.
