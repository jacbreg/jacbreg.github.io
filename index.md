Welcome to my website!

I am a PhD candidate at the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/).

My field of research is Organizational Economics.  
I work at the intersection of personnel economics, the economics of digitization, and behavioral economics.

I study incentive structures and information transmission both online and offline.
