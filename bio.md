# Bio

I am a PhD candidate at the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/). I obtained my Master's degree in Economic Theory and Econometrics at TSE, and a Bachelor's of Arts in Economics at the [University of Turin](https://en.unito.it/).

In my research I study incentive structures information flows in organizations and online communities. I employ structural and reduced form econometrics models. I work with big data, and exploit machine learning techniques for data processing and information extraction.

While I have been specializing in Economics, my interests expand to other social sciences. I have been working on Economics and Law with [Professor Daniel Chen](https://users.nber.org/~dlchen/), on Criminalogy with [Professor Federico Varese](https://federicovarese.com/), and studied Social and Cultural Anthropology with [Professor Pier Paolo Viazzo](https://www.dcps.unito.it/do/docenti.pl/Show?_id=pviazzo#tab-profilo).
