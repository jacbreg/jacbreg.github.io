I am a PhD candidate at the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/). I obtained my Master's degree in Economic Theory and Econometrics at TSE, and a Bachelor's of Arts in Economics at the [University of Turin](https://en.unito.it/).

In my research I study incentive structures and information flows in organizations and online communities. I employ structural and reduced form econometrics models. I work with big data, and exploit machine learning techniques for data processing and information extraction.

While I have been specializing in Economics, my interests expand to other social sciences. I have been working in Law and Economics with [Professor Daniel Chen](https://users.nber.org/~dlchen/), on Criminology with [Professor Federico Varese](https://federicovarese.com/), and studied Social and Cultural Anthropology with [Professor Pier Paolo Viazzo](https://www.dcps.unito.it/do/docenti.pl/Show?_id=pviazzo#tab-profilo). In addition, my research opened me to the literature at the intersection of sociology and computer science, as well as information science.  
Apparently distant from each other, they all relate to the main motive of my research: the understanding of the organization of human interactions. I am interested in particular on individual behavior within communities, when the institutional framework may be weak. This is the case in criminal organizations, as of course interpersonal commitments and contracts are not enforced by the law. Nevertheless, even legal companies are concerned, as a lot of interactions within teams are based on informal rules. In online communities finally, as well as for criminal organizations, relationships are not binded by contracts.  
In all these contexts, behavior may not be enforceable: this is why my research strongly relate to incentive design and the strategic allocation of resources, tasks, and information.
