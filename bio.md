# Bio

After completing my Bachelor's in Economics at the University of Turin in July 2013, my home city, I joined the Toulouse School of Economics for the Master's program, and started the PhD in September 2015.

In my research I employ structural and reduced form econometrics model to study incentive structures and information flows in organizations.

While I have been specializing in Economics, my interests expand to other social sciences: during my bachelor program I followed courses in Social and Cultural Anthropology. 
In the master's internship I worked as research assistant in a project of Criminology, at the Extra-Legal Governance Institute, and my RA work with Professor Daniel Chen introduced me to the Legal Studies.
