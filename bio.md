# Bio

I am a PhD candidate at the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/). I obtained my Master's degree in Economic Theory and Econometrics at TSE, and a Bachelor's of Arts in Economics at the [University of Turin](https://en.unito.it/).

In my research I study incentive structures and information flows in organizations and online communities. I employ structural and reduced form econometrics models. I work with big data, and exploit machine learning techniques for data processing and information extraction.

While I have been specializing in Economics, my interests expand to other social sciences. I have been working on Law and Economics with [Professor Daniel Chen](https://users.nber.org/~dlchen/), on Criminology with [Professor Federico Varese](https://federicovarese.com/), and studied Social and Cultural Anthropology with [Professor Pier Paolo Viazzo](https://www.dcps.unito.it/do/docenti.pl/Show?_id=pviazzo#tab-profilo). In addition, my research opened me to the literature at the intersection of sociology and computer science, as well as information science.  
At the core of these interests, what motivates my research is the understanding of the organization of human interactions. I am interested in particular on individual behavior within communities, when the institutional framework may be weak. Within criminal organizations, as well as inside teams of formal companies, or within online communities, interpersonal commitments and labor contracts rely on some degree of informality. I study human preferences that may affect interactions specifically in these types of contexts, and the incentive structures that could be implemented to regulate behavior.
