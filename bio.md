# Bio

After completing my Bachelor's in Economics at the [University of Turin](https://en.unito.it/) in July 2013, my home city, I joined the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu/) for the Master's program, and started the PhD in September 2015.

In my research I employ structural and reduced form econometrics models to study incentive structures and information flows in organizations and online communities. I work with big data, and exploit machine learning techniques for data processing and information extraction.

While I have been specializing in Economics, my interests expand to other social sciences: during my bachelor program I followed the courses in Social and Cultural Anthropology by [Professor Pier Paolo Viazzo](https://www.dcps.unito.it/do/docenti.pl/Show?_id=pviazzo#tab-profilo). 
In the master's internship I worked as research assistant in a project of Criminology, at the Extra-Legal Governance Institute with [Professor Federico Varese](https://federicovarese.com/), and my RA work with [Professor Daniel Chen](https://users.nber.org/~dlchen/) introduced me to Legal Studies and the field of Law and Economics.
